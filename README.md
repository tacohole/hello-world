# hello-world
hello world, I am an aspiring programmer. Or something like that, some job that in some way makes use of my 
customer service skills along with incorporating my nascent abilities in javascript, ruby, and/or python.
We'll see how things go but I'm learning a lot and challenging myself so that's not a bad start!
